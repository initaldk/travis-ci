  "body": "# Travis CI\r\n\r\n[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) is a hosted continuous integration and\r\ndeployment system. There are two versions of it,\r\n[travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com) for private repositories, and\r\n[travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org) for public repositories.\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the [central issue\r\ntracker](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues) for the Travis CI\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the Travis CI project can be found at\r\n<http://docs.travis-ci.com>.\r\n\r\n## Other repositories\r\n\r\nTravis CI consists of many different sub-projects. The main ones are:\r\n\r\n### travis-api\r\n\r\n[travis-api](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-api) is the Sinatra app that's\r\nresponsible for serving our API. It responds to different HTTP endpoints and\r\nruns services in [travis-core](#travis-core). Very little logic is in this\r\nrepository.\r\n\r\n### travis-build\r\n\r\n[travis-build](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build) creates the build\r\nscript for each job. It takes the configuration from the `.travis.yml` file and\r\ncreates a `bash` script that is then run in the build environment by\r\n[travis-worker](#travis-worker).\r\n\r\n### travis-core\r\n\r\n[travis-core](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-core) holds most of the logic\r\nfor Travis CI. This repository is shared across several other apps and\r\nholds the models, services, and other things that these apps need.\r\n\r\n### travis-cookbooks\r\n\r\n[travis-cookbooks](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks) holds the\r\n[Chef](http://docs.opscode.com/) cookbooks that are used to provision the build environments.\r\n\r\n### travis-hub\r\n\r\n[travis-hub](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-hub) collects events from\r\nother apps and notifies other apps about the events. For example, it notifies\r\n[travis-tasks](#travis-tasks) about builds starting and finishing so\r\nnotifications can be sent out.\r\n\r\ntravis-hub is also responsible for enqueueing jobs that have been created and\r\nenforcing the Quality of Service restrictions, such as the number of concurrent\r\nbuilds per user.\r\n\r\n### travis-listener\r\n\r\n[travis-listener](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-listener) receives\r\nnotifications from GitHub whenever commits are pushed or pull requests are\r\nopened. They are then pushed onto RabbitMQ for other apps to process.\r\n\r\n### travis-logs\r\n\r\n[travis-logs](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-logs) receives log updates\r\nfrom [travis-worker](#travis-worker), saves them to the database and pushes\r\nthem to the [web client](#travis-web). When a job is finished, travis-logs is\r\nresponsible for pushing the log to Amazon S3 for archiving.\r\n\r\n### travis-support\r\n\r\n[travis-support](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-support) holds shared\r\nlogic for the different Travis CI apps. It is different from travis-core in\r\nthat it holds more generic things, like how to run an async job or how to\r\nhandle exceptions.\r\n\r\n### travis-tasks\r\n\r\n[travis-tasks](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-tasks) receives\r\nnotifications from [travis-hub](#travis-hub) and sends out notifications to the\r\ndifferent notification providers as needed.\r\n\r\n### travis-web\r\n\r\n[travis-web](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web) is our main Web client.\r\nIt is written using [Ember](http://emberjs.com) and communicates with\r\n[travis-api](#travis-api) to get information and gets live updates from\r\n[travis-hub](#travis-hub) and [travis-logs](#travis-logs) through\r\n[Pusher](http://pusher.com/).\r\n\r\n### travis-worker\r\n\r\n[travis-worker](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-worker) is responsible for\r\nrunning the build scripts in a clean environment. It streams the log output to\r\n[travis-logs](#travis-logs) and pushes state updates (build starting/finishing)\r\nto [travis-hub](#travis-hub).\r\n",
